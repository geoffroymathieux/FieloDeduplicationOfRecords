DEPUPLICATION OF RECORDS (mergedMember)

static void FieloPLT.MemberService.mergeMember (Map<Id,Id> mapMembersMerge, Boolean recalculateLevels, Boolean reparentOnline, String confJson)

Fielo has developed APIâ€™s for the deduplication of records. The mergedMember method merges duplicate records of Members to render accurate loyalty point count and data rendered for each Member. A static resource (MembersMerge) specifies criteria for resolving field-level differences in duplicate Member records.  Each product (PLT, ELR, PRP, etc.) has a static resource defined in the Resources field.  The static resource has a JSON with the attributes of each member to be merged.
